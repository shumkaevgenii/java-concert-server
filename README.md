The radio station decided to hold a concert at the request of radio listeners. The concert program should include the most popular songs, in the opinion of radio listeners. To assess the popularity of songs and form a concert program, a server was created on which listeners could offer certain songs to the concert program and give their assessments. Based on the results of these proposals and evaluations, a program will be formed.
